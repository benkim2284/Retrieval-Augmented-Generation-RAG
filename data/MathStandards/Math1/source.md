(1) In previous grades, students had a variety of experiences working with expressions and creating equations. Students become
competent in algebraic manipulation in much the same way that they are with numerical manipulation. Algebraic facility
includes rearranging and collecting terms, factoring, identifying and canceling common factors in rational expressions, and
applying properties of exponents. Students continue this work by using quantities to model and analyze situations, to
interpret expressions, and to create equations to describe situations.
(2) In earlier grades, students define, evaluate, and compare functions, and use them to model relationships among quantities.
Students will learn function notation and develop the concepts of domain and range. They move beyond viewing functions
as processes that take inputs and yield outputs and start viewing functions as objects in their own right. They explore many
examples of functions, including sequences; interpret functions given graphically, numerically, symbolically, and verbally;
translate between representations; and understand the limitations of various representations. They work with functions
given by graphs and tables, keeping in mind that, depending upon the context, these representations are likely to be
approximate and incomplete. Their work includes functions that can be described or approximated by formulas as well as
those that cannot. When functions describe relationships between quantities arising from a context, students reason with
the units in which those quantities are measured. Students build on and informally extend their understanding of integer
exponents to consider exponential functions. They compare and contrast linear and exponential functions, distinguishing
between additive and multiplicative change. They interpret arithmetic sequences as linear functions and geometric
sequences as exponential functions.
(3) In previous grades, students learned to solve linear equations in one variable and applied graphical and algebraic methods
to analyze and solve systems of linear equations in two variables. Building on these earlier experiences, students analyze
and explain the process of solving an equation and justify the process used in solving a system of equations. Students
develop fluency in writing, interpreting, and translating among various forms of linear equations and inequalities and use
them to solve problems. They master the solution of linear equations and apply related solution techniques and the laws
of exponents to the creation and solution of simple exponential equations. Students explore systems of equations and
inequalities, and they find and interpret their solutions. All of this work is grounded on understanding quantities and on
relationships among them. 
(4) Students’ prior experiences with data are the basis for the more formal means of assessing how a model fits data. Students
use regression techniques to describe approximately linear relationships among quantities. They use graphical representations and knowledge of the context to make judgments about the appropriateness of linear models. With linear models, they
look at residuals to analyze the goodness of fit.
(5) In previous grades, students were asked to draw triangles based on given measurements. They also have prior experience
with rigid motions (translations, reflections, and rotations) and have used these experiences to develop notions about what
it means for two objects to be congruent. Students establish triangle congruence criteria, based on analyses of rigid motions
and formal constructions. They solve problems about triangles, quadrilaterals, and other polygons. They apply reasoning to
complete geometric constructions and explain why they work.
(6) Building on their work with the Pythagorean Theorem in eighth grade to find distances, students use a rectangular coordinate
system to verify geometric relationships, including properties of special triangles and quadrilaterals and slopes of parallel
and perpendicular lines.

absolute value, exponential, and logarithmic functions. 
12. Graph the solutions to a linear inequality in two variables as a half-plane (excluding the boundary in the case of a strict

Functions
Interpreting Functions F-IF
Understand the concept of a function and use function notation. [Learn as general principle. Focus on linear and exponential (integer domains) and on arithmetic and geometric sequences.]
1. Understand that a function from one set (called the domain) to another set (called the range) assigns to each element
of the domain exactly one element of the range. If f is a function and x is an element of its domain, then f(x) denotes the
output of f corresponding to the input x. The graph of f is the graph of the equation y = f(x).
2. Use function notation, evaluate functions for inputs in their domains, and interpret statements that use function notation in
terms of a context.
3. Recognize that sequences are functions, sometimes defined recursively, whose domain is a subset of the integers.
For example, the Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively by f(0) = f(1) = 1, f(n + 1) = f(n) + f(n − 1) for n ≥ 1.

the quantities, and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description of the relationship. Key features include:
intercepts; intervals where the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative maximums and minimums;
symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity. 
5. Relate the domain of a function to its graph and, where applicable, to the quantitative relationship it describes. For example,
if the function h gives the number of person-hours it takes to assemble n engines in a factory, then the positive integers
would be an appropriate domain for the function. 
6. Calculate and interpret the average rate of change of a function (presented symbolically or as a table) over a specified

a. Prove that linear functions grow by equal differences over equal intervals, and that exponential functions grow by equal
factors over equal intervals. 
b. Recognize situations in which one quantity changes at a constant rate per unit interval relative to another. 
c. Recognize situations in which a quantity grows or decays by a constant percent rate per unit interval relative to another. 
2. Construct linear and exponential functions, including arithmetic and geometric sequences, given a graph, a description of a
relationship, or two input-output pairs (include reading these from a table). 
3. Observe using graphs and tables that a quantity increasing exponentially eventually exceeds a quantity increasing linearly,
quadratically, or (more generally) as a polynomial function. 

of point, line, distance along a line, and distance around a circular arc.
2. Represent transformations in the plane using, e.g., transparencies and geometry software; describe transformations as
functions that take points in the plane as inputs and give other points as outputs. Compare transformations that preserve
distance and angle to those that do not (e.g., translation versus horizontal stretch).
3. Given a rectangle, parallelogram, trapezoid, or regular polygon, describe the rotations and reflections that carry it onto
itself.
4. Develop definitions of rotations, reflections, and translations in terms of angles, circles, perpendicular lines, parallel lines,
and line segments.
5. Given a geometric figure and a rotation, reflection, or translation, draw the transformed figure using, e.g., graph paper,
tracing paper, or geometry software. Specify a sequence of transformations that will carry a given figure onto another.
Understand congruence in terms of rigid motions. [Build on rigid motions as a familiar starting point for development of
concept of geometric proof.]
6. Use geometric descriptions of rigid motions to transform figures and to predict the effect of a given rigid motion on a given
figure; given two figures, use the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions to decide if they are congruent.
7. Use the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions to show that two triangles are congruent if and only if corresponding pairs of sides and corresponding pairs of angles are congruent.
8. Explain how the criteria for triangle congruence (ASA, SAS, and SSS) follow from the definition of congruence in terms of
rigid motions.
