(1) Students extend the laws of exponents to rational exponents and explore distinctions between rational and irrational
numbers by considering their decimal representations. Students learn that when quadratic equations do not have real
solutions, the number system must be extended so that solutions exist, analogous to the way in which extending the whole
numbers to the negative numbers allows x + 1 = 0 to have a solution. Students explore relationships between number
systems: whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers. The guiding principle is that
equations with no solutions in one number system may have solutions in a larger number system.
(2) Students consider quadratic functions, comparing the key characteristics of quadratic functions to those of linear and
exponential functions. They select from among these functions to model phenomena. Students learn to anticipate the graph
of a quadratic function by interpreting various forms of quadratic expressions. In particular, they identify the real solutions
of a quadratic equation as the zeros of a related quadratic function. When quadratic equations do not have real solutions,
students learn that that the graph of the related quadratic function does not cross the horizontal axis. They expand their
experience with functions to include more specialized functions—absolute value, step, and those that are piecewise-defined.
(3) Students begin by focusing on the structure of expressions, rewriting expressions to clarify and reveal aspects of the
relationship they represent. They create and solve equations, inequalities, and systems of equations involving exponential
and quadratic expressions.
(4) Building on probability concepts that began in the middle grades, students use the language of set theory to expand their
ability to compute and interpret theoretical and experimental probabilities for compound events, attending to mutually
exclusive events, independent events, and conditional probability. Students should make use of geometric probability
models wherever possible. They use probability to make informed decisions.
(5) Students apply their earlier experience with dilations and proportional reasoning to build a formal understanding of similarity.
They identify criteria for similarity of triangles, use similarity to solve problems, and apply similarity in right triangles to
understand right triangle trigonometry, with particular attention to special right triangles and the Pythagorean Theorem.
Students develop facility with geometric proof. They use what they know about congruence and similarity to prove theorems
involving lines, angles, triangles, and other polygons. They explore a variety of formats for writing proofs.
