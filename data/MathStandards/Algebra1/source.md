(1) In previous grades, students learned to solve linear equations in one variable and applied graphical and algebraic methods
to analyze and solve systems of linear equations in two variables. In Algebra I, students analyze and explain the process
of solving an equation and justify the process used in solving a system of equations. Students develop fluency in writing,
interpreting, and translating among various forms of linear equations and inequalities and use them to solve problems. They
master the solution of linear equations and apply related solution techniques and the laws of exponents to the creation and
solution of simple exponential equations.
(2) In earlier grades, students define, evaluate, and compare functions and use them to model relationships between quantities.
In Algebra I, students learn function notation and develop the concepts of domain and range. They focus on linear, quadratic,
and exponential functions, including sequences, and also explore absolute value, step, and piecewise-defined functions;
they interpret functions given graphically, numerically, symbolically, and verbally; translate between representations; and
understand the limitations of various representations. Students build on and extend their understanding of integer exponents
to consider exponential functions. They compare and contrast linear and exponential functions, distinguishing between
additive and multiplicative change. Students explore systems of equations and inequalities, and they find and interpret their
solutions. They interpret arithmetic sequences as linear functions and geometric sequences as exponential functions.
(3) Students extend the laws of exponents to rational exponents involving square and cube roots and apply this new
understanding of number; they strengthen their ability to see structure in and create quadratic and exponential expressions.
They create and solve equations, inequalities, and systems of equations involving quadratic expressions. Students become
facile with algebraic manipulation, including rearranging and collecting terms, and factoring, identifying, and canceling
common factors in rational expressions. Students consider quadratic functions, comparing the key characteristics of
quadratic functions to those of linear and exponential functions. They select from these functions to model phenomena.
Students learn to anticipate the graph of a quadratic function by interpreting various forms of quadratic expressions.
In particular, they identify the real solutions of a quadratic equation as the zeros of a related quadratic function. Students
expand their experience with functions to include more specialized functions—absolute value, step, and those that are
piecewise-defined.
(4) Building upon their prior experiences with data, students explore a more formal means of assessing how a model fits data.
Students use regression techniques to describe approximately linear relationships between quantities. They use graphical
representations and knowledge of context to make judgments about the appropriateness of linear models. With linear
models, they look at residuals to analyze the goodness of fit.

Number and Quantity
The Real Number System N-RN
Extend the properties of exponents to rational exponents.
1. Explain how the definition of the meaning of rational exponents follows from extending the properties of integer exponents
to those values, allowing for a notation for radicals in terms of rational exponents. For example, we define 51/3 to be the
cube root of 5 because we want (51/3)3
 = 5(1/3)3 to hold, so (51/3)3 must equal 5.
2. Rewrite expressions involving radicals and rational exponents using the properties of exponents.
Use properties of rational and irrational numbers.
3. Explain why the sum or product of two rational numbers is rational; that the sum of a rational number and an irrational
number is irrational; and that the product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number is irrational.

12t ≈ 1.01212t to reveal the approximate equivalent monthly interest rate if the annual
rate is 15%.

Functions
Interpreting Functions F-IF
Understand the concept of a function and use function notation. [Learn as general principle; focus on linear and
exponential and on arithmetic and geometric sequences.]
1. Understand that a function from one set (called the domain) to another set (called the range) assigns to each element
of the domain exactly one element of the range. If f is a function and x is an element of its domain, then f(x) denotes the
output of f corresponding to the input x. The graph of f is the graph of the equation y = f(x).
2. Use function notation, evaluate functions for inputs in their domains, and interpret statements that use function notation
in terms of a context.
3. Recognize that sequences are functions, sometimes defined recursively, whose domain is a subset of the integers.
For example, the Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively by f(0) = f(1) = 1, f(n + 1) = f(n) + f(n − 1) for n ≥ 1.

intercepts; intervals where the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative maximums and minimums;
symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity. 
5. Relate the domain of a function to its graph and, where applicable, to the quantitative relationship it describes. For example,
if the function h gives the number of person-hours it takes to assemble n engines in a factory, then the positive integers
would be an appropriate domain for the function. 
6. Calculate and interpret the average rate of change of a function (presented symbolically or as a table) over a specified

a. Use the process of factoring and completing the square in a quadratic function to show zeros, extreme values, and
symmetry of the graph, and interpret these in terms of a context.
b. Use the properties of exponents to interpret expressions for exponential functions. For example, identify percent rate of
change in functions such as y = (1.02)t
, y = (0.97)t
, y = (1.01)12t, and y = (1.2)t/10, and classify them as representing
exponential growth or decay.
9. Compare properties of two functions each represented in a different way (algebraically, graphically, numerically in tables, or
by verbal descriptions). For example, given a graph of one quadratic function and an algebraic expression for another, say
which has the larger maximum.

of a cooling body by adding a constant function to a decaying exponential, and relate these functions to the model. 
2. Write arithmetic and geometric sequences both recursively and with an explicit formula, use them to model situations, and
translate between the two forms. 
Build new functions from existing functions. [Linear, exponential, quadratic, and absolute value; for F.BF.4a, linear only]
3. Identify the effect on the graph of replacing f(x) by f(x) + k, kf(x), f(kx), and f(x + k) for specific values of k (both positive
and negative); find the value of k given the graphs. Experiment with cases and illustrate an explanation of the effects on the
graph using technology. Include recognizing even and odd functions from their graphs and algebraic expressions for them.
4. Find inverse functions.
