EPISODE 2 RECAP



Terrified by the soulless look in Sae-ro-yi’s eyes when he’d left Dad’s funeral, Soo-ah had sought out the detectives for help. Calling Sae-ro-yi from the back of the squad car, Soo-ah learns he’s at the hospital and desperately pleads the detectives to drive faster. Meanwhile, Sae-ro-yi has found Geun-won and sneers that Geun-won’s blatant terror only confirms his guilt in Dad’s death. Blinded by rage and despair, Sae-ro-yi viciously attacks Geun-won, who can only choke out weak apologies between sobs.

Alas, the apologies are too little too late and with Dad gone, Sae-ro-yi has nothing left to lose. Lifting a nearby rock over his head, Sae-ro-yi is about to send Geun-won to meet Dad when a gunshot rings out. Sae-ro-yi freezes, but thankfully, the shot was aimed into the air. The detectives have arrived with Soo-ah and Detective Oh points the gun at Sae-ro-yi, urging him to drop the rock. Sae-ro-yi sobs that Geun-won murdered his father and Detective Oh promises to investigate but orders him to discard the rock.



Despite Soo-ah’s pleas, Sae-ro-yi makes no move to either drop the rock or attack. Detective Oh cocks the gun and Sae-ro-yi smirks, “You can shoot. You see, I don’t care about anything anymore.” Detective Oh is about to squeeze the trigger when Soo-ah leaps between them. Both men tell her to step aside, but Soo-ah rounds on Sae-ro-yi and cries that Dad would never approve of him ruining his life over scum like Geun-won.

Finally breaking, Sae-ro-yi drops the rock to his side as he flashes back to Dad telling him how proud he was of they way Sae-ro-yi is living. The rock falls to the ground as Sae-ro-yi collapses into sobs as the rain continues to pour. Eventually, he’s loaded into the back of the squad car while Geun-won is put back in his hospital bed, both boys looking somber as they sit, lost in thought.



The next day, a student bursts into the classroom, announcing that Geun-won was responsible for the hit-and-run that killed Sae-ro-yi’s dad and there was a huge commotion at the hospital. Another student scoffs that even Geun-won can’t get away with murder, but someone else fires back that President Jang can cover up pretty much everything. They all agree that Sae-ro-yi got expelled for hitting Geun-won just once.


Meanwhile, Geun-won lies in his hospital bed, reliving the events of that fateful night. He’d crawled out of his smoking car, cradling his arm and peered over the guardrail where Dad lay, unmoving. Geun-won had pulled out his phone and started to dial, but the fear began to sink in, and he dropped it before completing the call. With a cry of frustration, he’d banged on the hood of his car while Dad lay dying just a few feet away.



President Jang, however, feels none of his son’s remorse as he visits Sae-ro-yi at the detention center. He claims to feel sorry for Sae-ro-yi’s loss, but quickly reprimands him for taking his anger out on Geun-won. Sae-ro-yi coldly asks why President Jang has come, but President Jang continues as if he didn’t hear him, saying that his 20 year relationship with Dad makes seeing Sae-ro-yi locked up difficult but that he’s clearly not reflected on his actions. “It makes me want to correct you for some reason,” President Jang says, piteously.

Unmoved, Sae-ro-yi asks again why President Jang has come and President Jang says he’s once again offering Sae-ro-yi a second chance. “What do you say? If you self-reflect and apologize to my son on your knees…” President Jang trails off as Sae-ro-yi shoots to his feet, enraged by the older man’s audacity. “Your son is the one who should get on his knees,” Sae-ro-yi spits, trembling. President Jang scoffs at how Dad must’ve taught Sae-ro-yi.



Leaning close to the glass, President Jang sneers that beliefs and ambition are just words used by people who have nothing but ego. Without any gain, those people are just being stubborn and foolish. He decides to leave Sae-ro-yi in prison to “self-reflect” and sashays out of the room as Sae-ro-yi glares. Outside, President Jang’s assistant, Mr. Kim, informs him that the police superintendent took care of the detective that secured the CCTV footage of Geun-won’s car. He adds that the public defender suggested they reduce Sae-ro-yi’s sentence.


“He’s fearless,” President Jang muses, speaking of Sae-ro-yi, “It’s very strange. He gets on my nerves for some reason.” He asks about Soo-ah and learns she grew up at the orphanage Jang Ga used to sponsor, in addition to being a classmate of Geun-won. Mr. Kim points out they’ve already rendered her testimony useless by admitting the car belong to Geun-won — but had maintained it was driven by their gardener, who had turned himself into the police. President Jang confirms that Soo-ah is friends with Sae-ro-yi and resolves to meet with her anyway.



Soo-ah wrings her hands nervously as she sits across from President Jang in his home. He smiles as he pours her tea, chuckling he’s seen her at the orphanage. He asks if she’s friends with Geun-won, and Soo-ah simply replies they’re classmates, but admits to being friends with Sae-ro-yi. President Jang tells her his company runs a foundation and would like to sponsor her schooling. Soo-ah says her tuition is paid for (thanks to Dad) but President Jang waves it aside, saying she’ll still need living expenses.

“And in return?” Soo-ah asks, wondering if President Jang wishes her to testify against Sae-ro-yi. President Jang laughs it off, saying that Sae-ro-yi’s delusions are quite sad and he merely wants to do a good deed. He tells Mr. Kim to arrange everything just as Geun-won bursts into the room. He freezes when he sees Soo-ah and President Jang dismisses her. Geun-won asks why she’s here, but she only glares as she walks towards the door. President Jang stops her to ask what she would’ve said if he had wanted something in return. When Soo-ah can’t respond, President Jang laughs it off as a joke.



Soo-ah leaves and Geun-won asks why President Jang had called her there, but President Jang simply orders him back to the hospital. “Please let him free,” Geun-won blurts and pleads with his father to release Sae-ro-yi when he — Geun-won — is the one in the wrong. President Jang barks that someone is already being punished for his crime, adding Geun-won may be his successor now, but replacing him with Jang’s illegitimate son is an option. As Soo-ah steps outside, she sees said illegitimate son playing with ants in the yard.

“In order to set him free,” President Jang reminds Geun-won, “you’ll have to admit that it was you.” Geun-won shrinks back, and President Jang says nothing can be gained with a conscious. He leads Geun-won outside to the pigpen, musing that pigs are smarter than dogs. Despite this, people have no problem eating pork, while condemning anyone eating dog meat. “But then again,” President Jang sighs, “dogs are very loyal and can be cute. It’s just a matter of perspective.”



President Jang tells Geun-won to consider the company employees and people below them that work for money as dogs. Finally, they head into the chicken coop and Geun-won shuffles uncomfortably as President Jang snatches up a chicken, a wicked grin spread across his face. “From killing a chicken to business management,” President Jang declares, “you need to know and understand everything to become a true owner.”

Thrusting the chicken out to Geun-won, President Jang details how the chicken must be killed, plucked, and prepared. Geun-won shies away when ordered to kill the chicken, and President Jang threatens his position as successor. Geun-won nervously takes the chicken and President Jang grimaces that he’s only half the man Sae-ro-yi is. “But he’s just an animal, while you’re a human being,” President Jang asserts, angered Geun-won feels sorry even after Sae-ro-yi beat him twice.



President Jang orders Geun-won to think of Sae-ro-yi as the chicken. “If you’re my son, and the successor of Jang Ga,” he growls, “do not feel sorry to eat pork or chicken.” Geun-won steels himself and with a sneer, agrees that Sae-ro-yi is only livestock. With a scream, he twists the bird’s neck, staring in horror at his hands while President Jang chuckles gleefully.

The day of the trial, Soo-ah sits next to Detective Oh as Sae-ro-yi is sentenced. Detective Oh flashes back to when he confronted the police superintendent about Dad’s case. He’d pointed out that the gardener couldn’t have hit Dad because he was working at the time of the accident. The superintendent accuses him of gaining CCTV footage without permission and shreds the evidence. He orders Detective Oh to mind his own business if he doesn’t want to lose his job. In the present, Sae-ro-yi is given three years in jail.




A guard leads Sae-ro-yi to his cell with four inmates already inside. The guard warns them not to haze him, and the leader of the group, KIM HEE-HOON, chuckles they wouldn’t bother with a kid. As soon as the guard is gone, however, one of the lackeys smacks Sae-ro-yi upside the head for not kneeling to greet them. Sae-ro-yi stares blankly back, thinking of President Jang repeatedly demanding he kneel.

Infuriated by Sae-ro-yi’s insolence, the lackey kicks his knees to force a kneel, but Sae-ro-yi manages to remain standing. He wonders if it would be easier if he kneeled, laughing, almost maniacally, at everyone’s obsession with his knees. Remembering Dad’s wish for him to always be proud and confident, Sae-ro-yi stands with a smile. Predictably, it earns him a beating as all three lackeys descend on him while Hee-hoon looks on with a bemused expression.




Soo-ah visits Sae-ro-yi soon after and he waves off her questions about his bruised face with a cheeky grin. She tells him she got accepted to university and Sae-ro-yi congratulates her, wondering why she doesn’t seem happy. Soo-ah admits that Jang Ga offered her a scholarship for stopping him from killing Geun-won. She sniffles that she’s a coward, apologizing for accepting the money. Sae-ro-yi tells her it’s okay, and thanks her for stopping him from becoming a murderer.

“You made a choice. So just stick to it,” he says gently, “You did nothing wrong.” Soo-ah asks what he plans to do upon release and Sae-ro-yi sighs that an ex-convict can’t be a police officer. The prison has a large library, so he’d planned to study and found President Jang’s autobiography, instead. He was surprised to discover that President Jang had built his empire from the ground up and it inspired him to open a restaurant.



Soo-ah assumes he means to take revenge, but Sae-ro-yi just chuckles. He says he never considered revenge, just thought of what might be fun and flashes back to Dad gleefully talking about opening the restaurant and praising Sae-ro-yi’s cooking. A guard opens the door and Sae-ro-yi gets up to leave. Soo-ah stops him to ask why he asked for her number. Sae-ro-yi admits that even though she’d told him not to like her, he’d asked for her number because he did. “Do you still like me?” Soo-ah asks.


Sae-ro-yi smiles sheepishly and she teases that she doesn’t like guys who are poor, wondering if he plans to make a lot of money. Sae-ro-yi vows that his dream now is to become rich. As he walks back to his cell, Sae-ro-yi thinks, “I had a huge hole in my heart. I was lethargic. But strangely enough, I got so easily provoked by him. It was useless to resent anyone. Because my dad was already gone.” He muses that revenge was the last thing on his mind, but the word fills up his empty heart and he can’t wait to get out.



2 Years Later

Sae-ro-yi steps outside the prison, finally a free man once more. The leader of his cell inmates, Hee-hoon, is also released and nods to the company of gangsters waiting outside to greet him. While Sae-ro-yi declines his offer of a ride, Hee-hoon tells him to call if he ever needs help. As they drive away, one of Hee-hoon’s associates asks about Sae-ro-yi. The man notes Hee-hoon seems to care for Sae-ro-yi and Hee-hoon watches him fondly in the review mirror, saying he’s no one special, just a fearless and reckless guy.

A small bar is Sae-ro-yi’s first stop and when he orders soju, he pours an extra glass for Dad. A phantom memory sits across from him, asking how the alcohol tastes, and Sae-ro-yi replies it’s bitter. He then flashes back to President Jang’s words that belief and ambition are for suckers as he stares at the cover of Jang’s autobiography. When he’s drank enough, Sae-ro-yi leaves, telling the owner to throw out the book, as he’s memorized it. (Hee, he’s drawn devil horns on President Jang with the words “I can beat him”).




That night, Sae-ro-yi does push-ups among scattered printouts on the Jang family. At the bus station the next morning, he sees Geun-won on the news for assaulting an employee at a bar. The man had asked to see Geun-won’s ID and he’d accused the animal of not recognizing its owner. Video of the incident went viral and Jang’s stocks took a significant hit. On the bus, Sae-ro-yi unfolds the letter he’d received from Soo-ah and smiles as her voice narrates it.


Soo-ah admits she misses him and tells him that she lives in Itaewon. Unsure of what to write, she went on to describe Itaewon. Arriving in Seoul, Sae-ro-yi heads to Itaewon as Soo-ah’s letter continues how on October 31st every year, people celebrate Halloween. He looks around at all the sights Soo-ah depicted in her letter and smiles. Her letter finishes with a desire to see him again and a wish for his happiness, always.



As he walks down the street, someone in a bloody rabbit mask suddenly stops and makes a beeline for him, throwing their arms around him. Sae-ro-yi stumbles back and the assailant finally thinks to remove the mask, revealing Soo-ah’s grinning face. She pulls him into another hug and then leads him to a bar. They’re greeted by Hong Seok-cheon (cameoing himself) and he coos over Sae-ro-yi, asking if the pair are dating. Soo-ah sniffs that they’re not and warns Seok-cheon not to flirt with Sae-ro-yi or she’ll tattle to his partner. Hee.

Soo-ah asks what Sae-ro-yi has been doing since his release. Simply replying that he’d prepared a lot, Sae-ro-yi instead wonders if Soo-ah went to college. She nods happily, adding that she’ll start work next year… at Jang Ga. She recalls Sae-ro-yi had wanted to open a bar and asks if he’s still pursuing that. He confirms it and says he’s thinking of opening it in Itaewon. Soo-ah frowns that there’s a big difference between weekend and weekday foot traffic, and rent is astronomical. Sae-ro-yi, however, insists he loves the area.




When she presses him for details, Soo-ah does a double spit-take in Sae-ro-yi’s face when he replies that not only will he start his business in seven years, but he plans to go deep-sea fishing in the meantime. To his credit, Sae-ro-yi is unbothered by the shower and simply explains that it’s difficult for ex-convicts to find work — especially without a high school diploma. Soo-ah points out that when Sae-ro-yi had been convicted, she’d helped him liquidate Dad’s restaurant and claim his insurance money.

Sae-ro-yi adds Dad had also been saving him a college fund and Soo-ah questions why he would even need to go out to sea. “It’s the price of my dad’s life,” Sae-ro-yi admits, “It should be more meaningful.” A somber silence falls for a moment before Soo-ah asks when he’s leaving. Sae-ro-yi tells her next week, and that he’ll leave Itaewon on the next bus. Quickly swallowing her disappointment, Soo-ah suggests they make the most of their time, then.




As the pair frolic around Itaewon, Sae-ro-yi narrates that for the first time after his father’s death, he felt free from all his tormented and vengeful thoughts. “My first time in Itaewon. My first Halloween Day. With my first love,” he continues, “It was the perfect day for me, who was about to go on a long journey.” As Sae-ro-yi piggybacks Soo-ah home, she apologizes for joining Jang Ga and gives him permission to resent her.

Sae-ro-yi reminds her that she’d wished him happiness, now and always. He tells her that line from her letter got him through, so there’s no way he can resent her. “You’re just living your life,” he says, gently, “And I’m always grateful.” They reach Soo-ah’s house and they linger awkwardly outside her gate. Sae-ro-yi says he had a lot of fun and is unsure when Soo-ah asks when he’ll return. She suddenly blurts that her house is old and drafty, with just one room and one blanket.

“Do you want to stay tonight?” Soo-ah asks. Sae-ro-yi blinks back and reminds her he’s not rich yet. Skipping over to the gate, she cheekily tells him to forget it and disappears inside. As he turns to go, Soo-ah leans back outside and calls after him to take care of himself. They smile at each other and wave before parting ways. A week later, Sae-ro-yi reports to his ship.




7 Years Later

Soo-ah presents her concept for a bar at Jang Ga headquarters. Geun-won questions how her proposal for an unpleasant place called Vicious Bar is supposed to appeal and Soo-ah explains the Evil Nature Principle that suggests humans are fundamentally evil. She continues that in order to prevent society from collapsing, people repress themselves with manners, consideration, morals, and the law. “What if Vicious Bar can relieve your stress?” she asks, pointedly. President Jang finds her idea interesting and gives her the green light.

Geun-won catches Soo-ah after the meeting to ask why she’s treating him coldly. “Am I supposed to be warm?” she retorts. He asks what her plans are, and she says she’s going to Itaewon to meet with a store manager. He offers to give her a ride since they’re going the same way, but she’s rescued by the appearance of Min-jung (President Kim’s right-hand). Geun-won starts to whine, but the women ignore his pouting and leave together.




In Min-jung’s office, she praises Soo-ah’s competency and Soo-ah smoothly attributes it to Min-jung’s teachings. Min-jung questions whether Soo-ah will choose an alignment soon (within the company) and Soo-ah sidesteps by saying she still has much to learn. Changing topics, Min-jung admits she’d wanted to ask if Soo-ah was interested in a blind date. She notes that Soo-ah hasn’t dated since joining the company and Soo-ah says she’s too busy with the upcoming project.

Leaving the office, Soo-ah heads to Itaewon, thinking that she hasn’t seen Sae-ro-yi since that night in Itaewon. Just as she’s thinking that he memories have started to fade, someone calls out to her. Turning back, Soo-ah sees Sae-ro-yi climbing down a ladder outside a recently sold shop. “It’s been exactly seven years,” Soo-ah’s narration continues as her eyes glance at the sign above the door, “DANBAM” (which translates to “chestnut” or “sweet night”). Grinning, Sae-ro-yi asks how she’s been, and Soo-ah smiles back. “The 22-year-old guy’s plan that sounded rather absurd, but Sae-ro-yi made it happen,” Soo-ah’s voiceover says, “To him, it is only natural.”
